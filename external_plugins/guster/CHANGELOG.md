# Changelog

Notable changes. Earlier history is in `git log`.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-11-05

- **Workspace and group roots are no longer scored as projects.** A directory
  that holds other scanned projects (`~/IdeaProjects`, a per-group checkout
  root) carries group-level `AGENTS.md` files but is not a project: counting it
  inflated `Projects:` and turned one container's partial `.agents/` into a
  permanent placement failure. `registry.json` marks `container`, PCR/ICR skip
  them, and the report reads `Projects: 62 (workspace containers: 2)`.
- **PCR explains itself.** The raw column breaks a shortfall into extra
  top-level entries / missing slots / missing index. "9/41 · 25 extra entries"
  is actionable; "21.4%" alone reads like a crisis.
- Two boundaries are now written down instead of being implicit, so they stop
  coming back as "bugs": PCR's denominator is adopters only (a repo whose sole
  context asset is one well-placed `AGENTS.md` has nothing to place — demanding
  six empty slot directories there would be structure theater, and
  `<repo>/skills/` is product source in a skill repository, not unplaced
  context), and SIR does not scan arbitrary file content for token shapes (the
  release gate owns that; SIR only claims host configuration it actually read).

## 0.6.0 — 2026-11-05

Measurement honesty pass. Every change below removes a case where the score
claimed knowledge it did not have.

- **An empty denominator is now `n/a`, not 1.0.** A dimension with no evidence
  is dropped and the remaining weights are renormalized; a scope with no
  evidence reports `CHI: n/a`. This reverses the 0.5.5 behavior ("empty
  denominators still print `0/0` and score 1.0"), which let a scope with fewer
  artifacts outrank a measured one. `project`/`group` CHI therefore drops when
  their denominators are empty, and scores are no longer comparable across
  scopes with different coverage. RBR follows the same rule per component: a
  missing entry file is not a perfect budget.
- **Git probe failures are loud instead of clean.** `git ls-files` and
  `git log` returning an error used to look like "no tracked files" and "no
  commit dates": credentials read as isolated and state documents read as
  undated. Both now return `None`, surface as a new `git-unavailable` finding,
  and SIR counts the affected credentials as unverified. `registry.json`
  records `git_state` per project.
- **SIR stops punishing registered credentials.** The numerator is now
  unregistered-outside + tracked + unverified + inline, so a file declared in
  `~/.agents/credentials/registry.md` no longer costs points; previously 30 of
  31 in-place company `.env` files were counted as failures while the matching
  finding was suppressed. The `secret-outside-root` finding and SIR finally
  share one definition.
- **Dates are read where a freshness claim actually lives.** A filename date
  must open the name (`2026-11-05-x`, `20261105-x`); `ticket-20261105-notes.md`
  no longer counts as today's work. `最后更新` is matched in the first 40 lines
  only, so prose mentioning another file cannot date this one.
- **PHR sees directory pointers** (`knowledge/general/`) and resolves paths
  against the enclosing repository root, so `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and
  `.agents/README.md` stop reporting root-relative links as broken. The report
  states when the 200-file pointer cap narrowed the scan.
- **RBR probes the host that is actually installed.** It used to read
  `~/.zcode/AGENTS.md` only; a DSH-only machine measured 0 bytes and scored
  full marks. It now sums the entry files that exist, deduplicated by real path.
- **Wider credential detection, same read-only boundary.** `.env` discovery
  goes two levels deep instead of one, and inline detection covers `api_key`,
  `secret_key`, `auth_token` and `sk-…` shapes besides `Bearer`. Values stay
  redacted and are never printed.
- **ICR requires a non-empty index**: an empty `README.md` no longer counts as
  indexing `.agents/`.
- **`status` reports a snapshot instead of mixing two scans.** It used to run
  fresh policy against a cached registry; it now prints the cached registry plus
  the last `metrics.jsonl` entry, and says so.
- **`score --fail-under N`** turns CHI into an opt-in gate (exit 2). `score`
  still exits 0 by default.
- **`metrics.jsonl` records the scope and both value sets** (raw `metrics` and
  capped `scores`), so a trend line no longer mixes a budget ratio with a score.
- Knowledge files up to 8 MB are hashed (was 2 MB); oversized ones are counted
  in `knowledge_unhashed` instead of silently skipping single-source checks.
- The report now prints how many projects have no `.agents/` directory, which
  dimension had no evidence, and when the pointer scan was truncated.

## 0.5.5 — 2026-11-05

- FRS now counts state documents under the hub project root (`projects/`),
  `handoff/`, `provision/` and `.agents/plans/`, not only `kind: state`.
  Project `.agents/plans/*` therefore enters the FRS denominator, so a project
  or group with a stale plan loses freshness points instead of reporting
  `100.0 (0/0)`. Plans use the existing 90-day rule: a declared
  `verified_at`/`最后更新` or filename date, otherwise the last git commit of the
  repository that owns them. Stale-state findings now point at the offending
  in-scope document, so a project/group report explains the lost points instead
  of filtering the finding out as hub-level. Empty denominators still print
  `0/0` and score 1.0.
- `doctor --scope hub` reports the project cards known to the hub
  (`Projects: 3 (scanned roots: 0)`) instead of the number of scanned roots, and
  omits the empty `Workspaces:` header line when the scope has no workspaces.

## 0.5.4 — 2026-11-04

- Removed three skill sub-pages that nothing pointed at: `init/SETUP.md`,
  `use/OPERATE.md`, `test/SELFTEST.md`. `SKILL.md` carries the workflow itself;
  the sub-pages had drifted and were never loaded.

## 0.5.3 — 2026-11-04

- `doctor` reports exactly the dimensions that enter CHI for the run's scope.
  `--scope hub` no longer prints RBR/PCR/SIR rows it never scores, and the
  always-informational GCR value is labeled `Not counted in CHI`.
- `project` and `group` runs now apply one boundary to artifacts and findings:
  hub knowledge, hub state documents and the machine-level local wiki no longer
  sit in ICR/FRS/PHR denominators while their findings are filtered out. A
  denominator now only contains documents that can raise an in-scope finding,
  so those scopes no longer inherit a score from out-of-scope health.
- Removed the unused `templates/` file skeletons and `schema/*.json`: nothing
  read them, and the project `AGENTS.md` / `.agents/README.md` text already
  lives in `planner.py`. `templates/hub/` is the only shipped template set and
  `package.json` no longer ships `schema/`.

## 0.5.2 — 2026-11-04

- Bad plan files no longer crash: a non-object plan, a malformed operation, or an
  unreadable plan path fails through the `[guster] ...` / plan-error output and a
  non-zero exit.
- `guster apply --dry-run` is accepted as the documented explicit dry run and is
  rejected when combined with `--yes`.
- A missing `--root` workspace and an unreadable or non-object Guster config now
  fail loud instead of silently scanning defaults.
- Pointer health counts each target once per file, so a link whose text is also
  inline code is no longer double-counted.
- Project `.agents/README.md` and hub knowledge indexes are now actually
  pointer-checked; the filter listed them but they were never scanned.
- A refused `apply`, `init` or `hub init` prints `FAILED` instead of `APPLIED`.
- The home directory is no longer classified as a project just because it holds
  the user-level `~/.agents/`; a fresh `init --home` setup scores clean.
- The setup skill points at the shipped `skills/` directory.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-11-03

- Added reasoned `doctor.waivers` and precise pointer checks.
- Fixed double-counting of linked wiki files and OpenSpec state.
- Added `GUSTER_EXTRA_SKILL_ROOTS` for additional skill hosts.
