# Changelog

## 0.1.6

Full review pass; every item below was reproduced before fixing.

### Isolation and security

- **Shared-profile sessions no longer cross-wire downloads or network state.** Electron
  keeps one `webRequest` listener and one permission handler per session, and
  `will-download` fires for every webContents in the partition. Two sessions on the same
  `profile` used to fight over `setSavePath` (a download started in A could land in B's
  `downloads/`) and the newer session silently disabled the older one's failure
  tracking. Handlers are now installed once per Electron session and dispatched by
  webContents id (`src/main/malo/partition-hooks.ts`); a download with no owner is
  cancelled.
- **The demo stage now blocks redirects, not just navigations.** Server-side 3xx emits
  `will-redirect`, which was never hooked, so an allowlisted origin could 302 to an
  arbitrary one and the remaining steps ran there. Both events share one gate now.
- **`goto` obeys the scene allowlist.** `webContents.loadURL` does not emit
  `will-navigate`, so tool-initiated navigation was unchecked; the runner now asks the
  host policy first (`assertNavigationAllowed`).
- **`${env:NAME}` is limited to `SCENE_*`.** A third-party scene could interpolate any
  `process.env` value (cloud keys, tokens) into a URL or form field, and the allowlist
  was declared by that same scene. All three interpolation implementations share the
  same rule now (the third one, `interpolateScene`, had no guard at all).
- **`demo://` validates the scene id.** The protocol handler used the URL segment as the
  containment root, so `demo://scene/..%2Fprivate%2Fcredential.json` served files one
  level above the scenes root. It now applies `SCENE_ID_PATTERN`, and a 404 no longer
  echoes the resolved filesystem path to the page.
- **`--data-dir=~/.malo-browser` actually expands `~`** instead of creating a literal `~`
  directory (`--out` and `--scenes` too).
- Data dir and session dirs are created 0700; run reports, failure screenshots and
  encoded takes are 0600 (the legacy evidence writer was 0644).
- `GET /health` on a lease endpoint no longer enumerates `lease_id` / `agent_id`
  without a token.

### Recording and evidence

- **A rejected take no longer claims "no video was written"** while a playable mp4 sits
  on disk: the failed-evidence warning names the file and says it failed self-checks.
- Frame temp dirs (`<take>-frames`, `<take>-seq`) are cleaned even when encoding is
  rejected, so a failed take stops leaving hundreds of JPEGs behind.
- `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` now run with timeouts (120s metadata probe, 250ms/frame encode,
  20min ceiling) and are killed instead of hanging `stop()` forever. Whole-file decode
  passes (blackdetect, ssim) scale their timeout with the video length, so a long take
  is not failed by a flat cap; a buffer overflow reports itself instead of posing as a
  timeout.
- `capture.timeline_frames` reports the encoder's slot count instead of duplicating
  `video.frames`.
- The `steps_completed` / `steps_within_take` checks only consider steps executed inside
  the take; borrowing the whole scene's step list could pass a take that ran nothing.
- A failed evidence write no longer leaves the recorder stuck in "recording".

### Demo pipeline

- **Director shortcuts can no longer kill the app.** Every shortcut rejection used to
  reach the process-level `unhandledRejection` handler, which calls `app.exit()`; a
  routine "no scene loaded" or "nothing to step back to" ended the session. Shortcuts now
  surface the error in the UI.
- **`goto` / `login` no longer break every later visual step.** Navigation drops the
  injected overlay, and only load/switch re-injected it, so `goto` → `click` failed with
  `TypeError: … reading 'click'`. The overlay is now installed on demand (and re-injected
  after navigation as a best-effort step, so a landing page that redirects again cannot
  fail the take); `reset` / `stop` / `prev` recover too.
- `recorder.start` refuses while a scene is still loading instead of recording a
  half-initialised page.
- `runner.load()` is awaited, removing the load/start race that surfaced as
  "场景尚未就绪" on slow or redirected scenes.
- A failed `scene.load` no longer leaks an untracked `BaseWindow`.
- The documented-but-rejected scene fields now parse: `fill.target_text`,
  `press.modifiers`, and x/y coordinates for `click` / `fill` / `highlight` /
  `spotlight` / `mask` (and `target_text` survives normalization instead of being
  dropped).
- `scroll.behavior: smooth` is implemented; `annotate.position` now places the label
  where it says.
- Director step indexing uses one convention (last executed step), so a paused run no
  longer shows the completed step as both "current" and "next"; `app.error` no longer
  inherits a stale step index and screenshot.
- Blackout state is cleared on scene load and on a same-URL scene switch; leaving
  fullscreen re-applies the active scene's viewport instead of the pre-fullscreen one.

### Tools

- Action errors no longer carry the code twice
  (`E_SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND: E_SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND: …`).
- A selector with invalid syntax is `E_BAD_REQUEST` (400) on every tool instead of a
  misleading `E_STEP_TIMEOUT` (504).
- `extract` with an invalid selector is a 4xx instead of HTTP 200 with `count: 0` and an
  undeclared `error` field.
- `assert value` on a password input is rejected; comparing the redacted literal made
  `value: "[redacted]"` pass regardless of the real value.
- `press` validates the key name instead of reporting success for `Enterr`.
- `run_steps` rejects `login` (it can open a handoff window and type credentials) as the
  docs always claimed, and the docs now also list `close`.
- `network_capture` recovers after a failed `Network.disable` instead of being stuck.
- `ProfileStore` writes recover after one failed write instead of failing forever.

### Docs and packaging

- README/README_CN corrected where they contradicted the code: download policy (the agent
  runtime accepts downloads into the session dir, it does not need a scene policy),
  password redaction (`snapshot` returns `""` + `sensitive`, `[redacted]` is the
  interactive text), failed-step screenshots (only `assert`), `--data-dir=~`, and the
  scene-variable/`SCENE_` rule.
- `docs/malo-browser.md`: mutually exclusive login success heuristic, partition dir
  without the `persist:` prefix, updated `run_steps` blocklist, new permission/mode notes.
- The published field contract `schemas/scene.schema.json` accepts the same step fields
  as the runtime (`target_text`, `modifiers`, coordinate targets), and a unit test now
  fails when the two schemas drift apart — that drift is how the fields became
  documented-but-rejected in the first place.
- `SKILL.md`: `EADDRINUSE` advice distinguishes control / broker / lease, invalid
  selector is `E_BAD_REQUEST`, added `E_NAV_BLOCKED` and the `SCENE_` rule.
- `package.json` `files` now ships `docs/` and `schemas/`, which the bundled skill links
  to (the DSH bundle is still installed from the prebuilt Release tarball because `out/`
  is gitignored); `scripts/pack-dsh-bundle.sh` stages the same two directories.
- `package-lock.json` root version caught up with `package.json`.

Tests: 232 → 254.

## 0.1.5

- `scripts/pack-dsh-bundle.sh` builds and packs the prebuilt DSH bundle attached
  to the GitHub release. The DSH plugin is installed from that asset, because
  `out/` is gitignored and a source install would leave `index.js` pointing at a
  compiled entry that does not exist yet.

- Added the `network_capture` and `responses` session tools: subscribe to URL prefixes,
  navigate/interact, then poll the captured XHR/fetch response bodies. Capture reuses the
  page driver's single CDP attach (no second debugger, no focus change); the Network
  domain is enabled lazily with 64 MiB/8 MiB response buffers and disabled when the
  subscription clears.
- Records keep every response's metadata in one 500-entry window, while bodies are kept
  only for subscribed hits up to 200 records and a 16 MiB budget. Each body is capped at
  1 MiB (`body_truncated`); base64 payloads report `body_error: "binary"` instead of a
  lossy UTF-8 decode, and queued bodies report `"pending"`. Query envelopes use
  `has_more`, not `truncated`, so they cannot be confused with `body_truncated`.
- Capture state is session-private and in memory only: bodies never reach logs, evidence,
  traces or run reports, and `MaloNetworkInfo` is unchanged. A capture subsystem failure
  surfaces as `E_CAPTURE_UNAVAILABLE` (`ok: false`) instead of an empty list.

## 0.1.4

- `--mode=record` now leaves failed evidence for every pre-encode throw, including
  opening the stage. An unreachable page writes `<out>/<label>.evidence.json` with
  `status: "failed"`, `video: null`, the real Chromium code (`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`),
  the failing `error.step`, the steps captured so far and any partial `artifacts`; the
  original error and exit code 2 are unchanged. Covered by
  `tests/unit/phase0-failed-evidence.test.ts`.
- `resolveTool` keeps resolving `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` from `PATH` first and only then from
  the documented Homebrew/local directories; a real miss now throws a typed
  `DemoError` (`E_FFMPEG_MISSING`, exit 3) and the policy is unit-tested via
  `resolveToolOnPath`.

## 0.1.3

- Removed `docs/phase0-report.md`, `docs/phase1.md`, `docs/phase1b.md`: internal
  engineering reports, never linked from the README, the skill or any test.
- Removed `scripts/baseline_chrome.py`. It rebuilt a Chrome baseline from the
  author's private `~/recorder-pipe` virtualenv, so it could not run on another
  machine; `scripts/compare.cjs` still compares two recordings.

## 0.1.2

- `README.md` is English again and `README_CN.md` is its Chinese translation with
  the same section structure (install / run / scene scripts / recording and
  evidence / control API / troubleshooting / side effects / limitations). Both were
  re-checked against the current code for commands, flags, ports, paths and artifact
  names; the plugin packaging notes moved into the shared structure.
- An `assert` failure now uses the same contract as a failed `run_steps` batch:
  HTTP 200 with `result.ok: false`, per-check `expected`/`actual` on
  `result.checks` and `result.error.details.checks`, and the failure screenshot.
  Invalid arguments stay 4xx and real server failures stay 5xx. Callers that keyed
  on the old HTTP 500 must read `result.ok` instead — a 0.1.x contract change.
- App mode now leaves failed evidence when a take dies before encoding: a zero-frame
  `recordStop` (`E_RECORDER_NO_FRAMES`) and any other recorder stop failure write the
  take's `.evidence.json` with `status: "failed"`, `video: null`, `error.code` and
  `error.message` instead of only logging a line, matching `--mode=record`. Exit
  codes and control-API errors are unchanged.

## 0.1.1

- A failed step keeps one error-code prefix: `E_SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND: 找不到元素
  #m` instead of `E_SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND: E_SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND: ...` in stderr,
  the run snapshot and evidence step details.
- An autorun take that fails on a step now stops the recorder and writes
  failed evidence with the real cause, instead of exiting 2 with no artifact.
- Evidence no longer says `passed` for a run with a failed step: it records
  `status: failed`, the run error and `video.partial`, and `recorder.stop` only
  reports `E_EVIDENCE_MISMATCH` when a recording self-check fails.
- The human-handoff toolbar no longer shrinks the page: session `width`/`height`
  are the page viewport again (a 1280x800 session rendered 1280x756 before), and
  screenshots match the requested size. `npm run smoke:toolbar` checks it.
- An invalid scene lists the actual field errors in the message instead of only
  `N error(s)`.
- A busy broker/lease port points at `--daemon-port` / `--port-min`--`--port-max`
  instead of telling the user to change `--control-port`.
- Documented the handoff toolbar, `run_steps`, the session viewport rule, the
  `overlay-before` frame and the `smoke:toolbar` / `smoke:control` scripts;
  `package.json` now declares the published `files` list.

## 0.1.0

- Scene-driven Electron stage, hidden 1920x1080@30fps recording with evidence
  files, window modes, director console and loopback control API.
- `malo-browser` agent runtime: broker daemon, port leases, isolated sessions,
  page tools, `assert`, `run_steps`, login handoff, persistent profiles.
